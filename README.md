As you see, I'm not usually active on Github, as I also have interest in other things other than studying programming languages, such as paitings, OpenGl demoscenes and video editing.

This profile is mostly used for things that I do on my free time, like personal projects.

I started venturing in programming languages at the beginning of 2021, at the Tuiuti University of Paraná.

Feel free to fork, create a issue and criticize my projects.
